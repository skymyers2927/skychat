Welcome to SkyChat for Windows 

This is cool program i just made for fun. This program is completely open source. Feel free to edit this program as much as you want. 
The offical version of SkyChat we are now using is closed source. This version of SkyChat however, is open soruce and can be used as wanted or intedned too.


In the server version of SkyChat the Server shows your public IP Address and shows the ports that it is using we are working on a remastered version were the computer does not show any of the IP Address just a flaw that happended to sneek its way thru. 

The program can run on Windows 10 Computers or later offically. You also can try to use the code on Mac however there is a lot of things that get broken as this is a Windows Program.
